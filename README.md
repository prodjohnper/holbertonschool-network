## Description

This is my submission to the *Holberton Coding School* module of *Networking basics*. In this module we worked and learned about What is OSI Model, how many layers it has, how it is organized, what is LAN, typical usage, typical geographical size. what is WAN, typical usage, typical geographical size, what is the internetm what is an IP address, what are the 2 types of IP address, what is `localhost`, what is subnet, why IPv6 was created, what are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP(transfer level on the OSI schema), what is the main difference between TCP and UDP, what is a port, memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers and what tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network.
